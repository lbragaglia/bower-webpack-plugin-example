# bower-webpack-plugin-example
Taken from `bower-webpack-plugin` [README](https://github.com/lpiepiora/bower-webpack-plugin#example)

Using bower `overrides`: copied from [here](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/a10eb60bc0b07b747fa0c4ebd8821eb7307bd07f/bower.json#L17-L24) as suggested [here](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/06/15/bootstrap-3-3-5-released/#wiredep-and-bower) as a workaround for wiredep.

Not working because not yet implemented (see lpiepiora/bower-webpack-plugin#21).
